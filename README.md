# Virtual Piano to Rubber Ducky Script Converter 🎼 > 📜
------------------------------------------------
📄  Overview 
--------
Welcome to the Virtual Piano to Rubber Ducky Script Converter! This project provides a Python script that takes virtual piano sheets and transforms them into a Rubber Ducky script, specifically designed for use with the Flipper Zero or similar devices equipped with buttons. This tool emulates the auto piano feature found in the Roblox game https://www.roblox.com/games/8848607186/Digital-Piano-Free-Auto, allowing you to play songs effortlessly!

--------
⚙️  Features 
--------
- Conversion: Easily convert virtual piano sheet music into a script that can be executed on your Rubber Ducky or compatible device.
- User-Friendly: Designed for users with devices that have a button interface, making it simple to perform piano pieces automatically.
- Press the button (on, in my case my flipper zero) to send a keyboard output to the piano as it works like the auto piano in the mentioned roblox game where you press a button for the next note / chord to be played eg: a b c [de] f [gh].



---------------
✏️  Getting Started 
---------------
- Python 3.x installed on your machine (I use v3.11)
- Basic understanding of how to run Python scripts
- A Rubber Ducky (with button) or compatible device (like Flipper Zero (with BadUSB app))

-----
💾  Usage 
-----
Prepare your virtual piano sheet in the required format.
The script will generate a Rubber Ducky script that can be uploaded to your device.
Execute the script on your Rubber Ducky or Flipper Zero to start playing!
